Automatic License Number Plate Detection Using YOLO and EasyOCR
(PG DBDA - Final Project)

Tools Used: Python, Yolo, EasyOCR, Python Flask, Pycharm, keras, tensorflow, 
Pytesseract, Pytorch.

Description:
This project utilizes YOLO and EasyOCR, advanced computer vision technologies, to 
seamlessly and efficiently detect and extract alphanumeric characters from license 
plates with high precision. By automating the entire license plate recognition 
process, it minimizes the need for human involvement, offering widespread 
usability in diverse applications such as toll collection, parking management, and 
law enforcement.
